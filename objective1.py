    The analysis reveals significant disparities in rape case distribution across India in 2019. 
    Northern and central regions show the highest totals, while smaller northeastern states 
    report fewer cases but occasionally higher population-adjusted rates. 
    The bubble visualization indicates that states with large urban populations 
    not only record higher total cases but also exhibit elevated rape rates. 
    Age-based analysis demonstrates that adult victims form the majority, 
    although minor cases remain a notable share in several states. 
    Together, these patterns emphasize that both population density 
    and socio-demographic factors influence the occurrence and reporting of rape incidents.

    The distribution analysis shows that rape incidents are not evenly spread across India.  
    States such as **Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh** contribute a large proportion of 
    national cases, suggesting either higher crime occurrence or more efficient reporting.  
    The bubble chart demonstrates a moderate positive relationship between total cases 
    and rape rate, meaning states with higher numbers often face higher risk per capita.  
    The stacked bar comparison confirms that **adult women (18+)** remain the most affected group, 
    but **minor victims** form a persistent subset across states.  
    This spatial and demographic imbalance underlines the need for region-specific 
    policy interventions, awareness programs, and improved protection mechanisms 
    for vulnerable populations.

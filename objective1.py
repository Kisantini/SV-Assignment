    The analysis of rape case distribution in 2019 reveals clear regional and demographic trends. 
    The bar chart shows that northern and central states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh 
    reported the highest number of cases, suggesting potential socio-economic and reporting differences across regions. 
    The pie chart indicates that adults constitute the majority of victims, accounting for roughly three-quarters of the total, 
    while minors still represent a significant fraction. 
    The histogram demonstrates that most states maintain relatively low rape rates per population, 
    but a few outliers show substantially higher rates. 
    Overall, these findings highlight disparities across states and emphasize the need for targeted awareness 
    and preventive initiatives.

    The visualizations clearly depict uneven distribution of rape cases across India.  
    States with higher populations and greater urban density—such as **Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh**—
    record the most cases, though not necessarily the highest rates when adjusted for population.  
    The pie chart emphasizes that **adult women (18+) are the most affected**, highlighting gender-based vulnerability 
    among adult populations.  
    The histogram distribution shows that most states have moderate rape rates, 
    but outliers such as **Assam and Delhi** exhibit disproportionately high rates relative to population.  
    These results imply that both **population structure and local socio-cultural conditions** 
    influence the frequency and reporting of rape incidents.  
    Policymakers should focus on awareness, education, and stricter law enforcement 
    in states displaying both high total and high relative rates.

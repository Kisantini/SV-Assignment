    The objective is to identify whether states with high rape incidences also show

    The comparative analysis between rape cases and kidnapping/abduction for marriage (IPC 366) 
    highlights a consistent positive relationship across states. 
    The scatter plot clearly shows that regions with higher rape cases also tend to report 
    more kidnapping crimes. The horizontal bar chart provides an easy side-by-side comparison 
    for major states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, which exhibit particularly 
    high levels of both crimes. The pie chart emphasizes that although rape cases remain the 
    majority, kidnapping offenses account for a significant share of total gender-related crimes. 
    These visuals collectively demonstrate the interconnected nature of gender-based offenses 
    and underline the urgent need for comprehensive awareness, legal protection, and enforcement efforts.

    The simplified visuals reveal a clear and strong connection between rape and kidnapping/abduction incidents.  
    **States with higher rape reports ‚Äî such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar ‚Äî also show high kidnapping levels**, 
    suggesting similar social and cultural risk factors.  
    The grouped bar chart allows easy state-wise comparison, confirming that high population regions 
    contribute heavily to both crimes. The national pie chart clarifies that while rape cases dominate numerically, 
    kidnapping-for-marriage remains a persistent parallel issue.  
    This pattern implies that these crimes often coexist under shared conditions such as gender inequality, 
    weak deterrence, and inadequate awareness.  
    Thus, the findings highlight the importance of **integrated preventive strategies**, 
    combining education, legal reform, and stronger community engagement to reduce these intertwined crimes.

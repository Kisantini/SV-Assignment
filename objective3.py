    This analysis reveals a close association between rape cases and related crimes like 
    kidnapping or abduction for marriage (IPC 366). The scatter plot highlights a strong 
    positive relationship, where states reporting more rape cases also record higher kidnapping incidents. 
    The box plot shows significant variation, with a few states emerging as outliers with extremely 
    high kidnapping numbers, while most states fall within a moderate range. 
    The correlation heatmap confirms that these crimes are positively correlated, 
    suggesting shared underlying causes such as gender inequality, social pressure, 
    and inadequate legal deterrence. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated 
    preventive measures and improved enforcement mechanisms across regions.

    The updated visuals provide a clearer picture of how related crimes interact across regions.  
    The scatter plot shows a **strong positive correlation** between rape and kidnapping-for-marriage cases, 
    implying shared social roots and behavioral patterns.  
    The **box plot** highlights that most states report relatively low kidnapping rates, 
    but a few (like **Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar**) act as statistical outliers ‚Äî 
    representing much higher incident counts than the national average.  
    These outliers suggest deep-rooted cultural and socio-economic factors influencing both crimes.  
    The heatmap strengthens this observation, confirming a **consistent positive relationship** 
    among crime categories.  
    Overall, the analysis underlines the need for **comprehensive social reform, education programs, 
    and better coordination between law enforcement agencies** to mitigate such interconnected offenses.
